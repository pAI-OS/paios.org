Here's a quick demo of the Personal Artificial Intelligence Operating System (PAIOS) developed for [Kwaai](https://www.kwaai.ai), a California 501(c)3 nonprofit organisation.

pAI-OS, like Linux, allows users to bring together the best free and open-source software to securely use artificial intelligence agents with direct access to all of their own data.

Kwaai's mission is to empower users to retain and own their personal data and knowledge model, enhancing their digital abilities and competitiveness in the modern economy.
